Unity — uEvent & ScriptableObjects

Unity3D is a powerful suite of tools (Project IDE, Code IDE, and run-time) for game development. Unity supports several languages, but the community consensus is to use only C#.

What is an observer pattern? It is a code setup that defines a one-to-many relationship such that when one object changes state, the others are notified and updated automatically.

Here is the latest and greatest library I created using the aforementioned Observer Pattern, SOLID, KISS, and the unique benefits of Unity’s ScriptableObject and Unity’s UnityEvent. It is called UEvent and contains the UEvent namespace. As the “U” hints, this library is designed specifically for use with the Unity platform.
